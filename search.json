    "text": "Is the Big10 truly taking over the SEC’s spot as the best conference?\nLet’s look at last year’s stats to figure that out. I will be using the 2024 football logs from mattwaite.github.io.\nThe first stats that I want to take a look at is on the offensive side of the ball. While defense does win championships, you need to score to win. I am going to be looking at each SEC and Big 10’s rushing and passing game from last year.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nfootball &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/footballlogs24.csv\")\n\nBOff &lt;- football |&gt; \n  group_by(Conference, Team) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    RushingYards = sum(RushingYds),\n    PassingYards = sum(PassingYds))|&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Yards=RushingYards + PassingYards\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(Conference %in% c(\"Big Ten Conference\", \"Southeastern Conference\"))\n\nSOff &lt;- BOff |&gt; \n  filter(Conference %in% c(\"Southeastern Conference\"))\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=BOff, aes(x=reorder(Team, Yards), weight=Yards)) +\n  geom_bar(data=SOff, aes(x=reorder(Team, Yards), weight=Yards, fill =\"red\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\nlabs(\n    y = \"Total Offensive Yards\",\n    x = \"Team\",\n    title = \"10 of the top 15 offenses are in the SEC\",\n    subtitle = \"The SEC shows more depth when it comes to offense\",\n     caption=\"Source: mattwaite.github.io | By: JAGGER HOPKINS\"\n  ) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#| include: false\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSeeing that the SEC shows more depth when it comes to offense. Let’s take a look at their respective defenses. Like stated before defense wins championships, and the SEC has been known for having outstanding defense year in and year out. In this graph I will be showing you the defensive stats that are the most important to me. Limiting first downs is the foundation to a good defense, if they can’t get a first down, they cant move the ball. The other two stats are a little bit more obvious, who gets more takeaways and who limits touchdowns. Obviously you need to limit touchdowns, that is the entire point of the defense going on the field.If the defense can get takeaways and create opportunities for the offense, that’s when a defense beccomes lethal.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nfootball &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/sportsdatafiles/footballlogs24.csv\")\nBIGSEC &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Minnesota\", \"Illinois\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St\", \"Ohio State\", \"Purdue\", \"Indiana\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Alabama\", \"Arkansas\", \"Auburn\", \"Florida\", \"Georgia\", \"Kentucky\", \"LSU\", \"Mississippi State\", \"Missouri\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Ole Miss\", \"South Carolina\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas\", \"Texas A&M\", \"Vanderbilt\")\nDTab &lt;- football|&gt;\n  filter(Team %in% BIGSEC)|&gt;\n  select(Team, \n         DefFirstDownTotal, \n         DefTotalTurnovers,\n         DefRushingTD, \n         DefPassingTD)|&gt;\n  mutate_at(vars(-Team), as.numeric)|&gt;\n  group_by(Team)|&gt;\n  summarize(\n    TotalFirstDowns = sum(DefFirstDownTotal),\n    TotalTOs = sum(DefTotalTurnovers),\n    RushTD = sum(DefRushingTD),\n    PassTD = sum(DefPassingTD)\n  )|&gt;\n  mutate(TotalTD = RushTD + PassTD\n         )|&gt;\n  select(Team, TotalTOs, TotalFirstDowns, TotalTD)|&gt;\n  arrange(TotalTD)\nhead(DTab)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  Team       TotalTOs TotalFirstDowns TotalTD\n  &lt;chr&gt;
